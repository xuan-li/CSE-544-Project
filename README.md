## Data

Data can be downloaded from [here](!http://www.wikibench.eu/wiki/2007-09/).

Store all data into `./data` folder. Feel free to put big files in this fold because they will be ignored.



## TODO

- [x] Pick a raw dataset, process it, clean it (correct any errors or omit any outliers), and read it into a program.
- [ ] Form multiple different hypotheses about the dataset and provide references for supporting the hypotheses, if applicable.
- [ ] Analyze the processed data using multiple techniques to accept or reject each hypothesis.
- [ ] Provide a measure of confidence for each case, as applicable.
- [ ] Conclude with findings based on the data analysis.

![plot.png](https://github.com/xuan-li/CSE-544-Project/blob/master/plot.png)
Hypothesis 1: Access per minite distributions of two different weekdays are the same.

Hypothesis 2: Access per minite distribution of one day is a normal distribution.

Hypothesis 3: Average access per minite of weekdays is same with weekends.

Hypothesis 4: Peaks/Valley points of each day is the same.

Hypothesis 5: If two lemmas have common words, access correlation will increase.

Hypothesis 6: Big events have correlation with access of corresponding lemmas.

Hypothesis 7: The number of accessed lemmas per minite/second is a uniform distribution.
