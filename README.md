## Data

Data can be downloaded from [here](http://www.wikibench.eu/?page_id=60).

Each entry of data has the following information:
- A monotonically increasing counter (useful for sorting the trace in chronological order)
- The timestamp of the request in Unix notation with milli-second precision
- The requested URL
- A flag to indicate if the request resulted in a database update or not

Store all data into `./data` folder. Feel free to put big files in this fold because they will be ignored.
