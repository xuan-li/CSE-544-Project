      "As a consequence of bipedalism, human females have narrower [[birth canal]]s. The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. This means that human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal, which other primates do not do, and it makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it has provided an evolutionary advantage (more caring time) to young relatives.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n",

While the [[nucleotide diversity|nucleotide]] genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%, the genetic difference between [[Man|males]] and [[woman|females]] is between 1% and 2%. Although different in nature{{clarify|date=May 2014}}, this approaches the genetic differentiation between men and male chimpanzees or women and female chimpanzees. The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and {{Convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, men have about 40–50% more upper body strength and 20–30% more lower body strength than women. Women generally have a higher [[body fat]] percentage than men. Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]]. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and [[Disease|disorders]] only affect either men or women. Other conditional differences between males and females are not related to sex chromosomes. Even after allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an [[octave]] deeper than the female voice. Women have a [[Life expectancy#Sex differences|longer life span]] in almost every population around the world.<ref name=\"Birke, Lydia 2001\">Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader ed.

Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by [[social norm]]s: a person may be driven to [[self-injury]] or violence because their brain is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within [[psychology]], [[conflict avoidance]] and the [[libido]] are seen to be primary motivators.

There is often a distinction made between refined emotions that are socially learned and [[wikt:survival|survival]] oriented emotions, which are thought to be innate. Human exploration of emotions as separate from other neurological phenomena is worthy of note, particularly in cultures where emotion is considered separate from physiological state. In some cultural medical theories emotion is considered so synonymous with certain forms of physical health that no difference is thought to exist.

Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry.

Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n",

      "Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of economics. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n",

      "Economics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition.

      "War is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others—whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]—to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a civil war. Among animals, all-out war against fellow members of the same species occurs only among large societies of humans and [[ants]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n",

      "There have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n",
